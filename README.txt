*Scripts for MVT bias correction of NESM3 simulations during historical period and under four future senarios
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Before starting bias correction, all datasets should be regrided, as the script in regrid.zip

(2) The scripts in hist_correct.zip are for the bias correction of NESM3 simulations during historical period.
    Follow the scripts in folders: monavg -> cal_NLT -> detrend -> cal_stddev_Ratio -> Correct

(3) The scripts in future_correct.zip are for the bias correction of NESM3 simulations under four future senarios 
    Follow the scripts in folders: monavg -> cal_NLT -> detrend -> Correct
